TECHNICAL NOTES ABOUT DROWNING
------------------------------
To detect if the player is under water (to restore the oxygen timer), this
mod has to know about all the nodes considered "liquid". It currently handles
water_{source|flowing}, lava_{source|flowing}, and oil_{source|flowing} from
the Oil Mod.

The original drowning mod checked whether or not there was an air node at the
player's head, but this was inaccurate as you could "drown" by standing
"inside" a torch node, or other walkable nodes.

Unfortunately, both ways have disadvantages; as was said, in the old
 implementation, you can drown by being inside torches, lamps, etc. In the
 new implementation, however, you can catch breath by placing any node not
 considered "liquid" (for example, cobblestone) on your head.
