This mod adds drowning to the game. The player can drown after being under
 liquid (water, lava, etc.) for some time without breathing air again.

When drowning, the player will be hurt (and will hear a hurt sound); If the
 player does not get oxygen, he/she will be damaged again, and so on until
 he does or dies.

You can also craft a meter (or gauge). It shows your current hunger by means
 of a colored bar under the item (like tool wear). Craft it like this:

   +-------------+-------------+-------------+
   |             | wood planks |             |
   +-------------+-------------+-------------+
   | wood planks | glass       | wood planks |
   +-------------+-------------+-------------+
   |             | wood planks |             |
   +-------------+-------------+-------------+
